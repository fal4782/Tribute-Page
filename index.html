        <div class="content-heading"><p>Here are somethings to know about the Flame Hashira:</p>
          <ul id="info-list">
            <li>Kyojuro was one of the nine Hashira, a group of the nine greatest Demon Slayers in the Demon Slayer Corps. Specifically, Kyojuro was the Flame Hashira who made use of the Flame Breathing. </li>
            <li>While not having his life being directly affected by Demons like many other members in the Corps, Kyojuro household had produced Demon hunters for generations. Kyojuro, with his sense of duty instilled by his ailing mother since childhood, saw it as a duty to protect the innocent from Demons and entered the corps to serve humanity. </li>
            <li>Kyojuro was a young man with bright yellow hair with red streaks, black forked eyebrows, and golden eyes. He was fairly tall by Japanese standards and possessed a relatively muscular build.

His outfit consisted of the regular Demon Slayer uniform along with a Hoari which had a white-yellow gradient pattern and red flame-like ridges at the end.</li>
            <li>Kyojuro was greatly enthusiastic in regard to his duties as a Hashira and often cheerfully eccentric. He was incredibly charismatic and generous and was almost always seen with a jovial expression. He boasted extraordinary technique and swordsmanship stemming from strict practice and discipline.

Kyojuro was an honorable warrior who adhered to his code of morals and principles that was instilled into him by his mother during childhood, the most significant being that those who were born strong have a duty to protect the weak.</li>
            <li>Flame Breathing (炎の呼吸 Honō no kokyū): This technique allowed Rengoku to increase the amount of oxygen in his blood by controlling his breathing pattern, which increased his strength and agility to equal that of a demon. Kyojuro had learned to do full focus breaths at all times, further increasing his base strength, speed and stamina. By focusing his breathing on specific points, he was capable of stopping bleeding from injuries.</li>
            <li>His surname Rengoku means "purgatory" in Japanese.</li>
            <li>Kyojuro loved to watch sumo and wrestling.</li>
            <li>Kyojuro's favorite food was sweet potatoes and his favorite side dish was salt grilled bream.</li>
            <li>Kyōjurō's birthday was on May 10. He was 20 years old at the time of his death.</li>
            <li>Kyojuro always wanted a pet, but he has never been able to have one because of his father's hatred toward animals.</li>
            <li>Kyojuro is one of only 4 Hashira that use a standard Nichirin Katana. </li>
          </ul>
